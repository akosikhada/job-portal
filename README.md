## Tech Stack Used

The **MERN stack** is a popular web development stack that consists of four key technologies:

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, allowing for easy scalability and performance.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building server-side applications and APIs.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, allowing for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime that enables server-side scripting, allowing developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side code.

Together, these technologies provide a powerful framework for developing modern web applications.
